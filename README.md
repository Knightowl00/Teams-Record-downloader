# Teams-Record-downloader

My classes are conducted in MS teams and the recording of the classes expires after 20 days, so i made a program to login into my account and download the class recordings that took place in the day the program is runned and then upload the video to google drive where i can stream the videos. The videos are then deleted from my comptuer memory and the program also sends some commom errors to my discord server.
