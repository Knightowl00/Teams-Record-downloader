# Teams-Record-downloader

My classes are conducted in MS teams and the recording of the classes expires after 20 days, so i made a program to login into my account and download the class recordings that took place in the day the program is runned and then upload the video to google drive and then delete the video from my comptuer memory and  also to send any common errors faced to my discord server.
